# zerobasedbudgetingapp

## Goal

This is a test application to develop a basic zero based budgeting app.
The user is able to add and remove several transactions a single bankaccount.
The money he receives can be budgeted to different categories. Every transaction
has a specific category. The user can add/remove categories any time. Each category
shows the money that is left. Also there are warnings for overspending.

Things to consider after MVP:
- Creditcard
- Scheduled/Repeated transactions
- Grafical analysis of spent money in each category
- Multiple bankaccounts
- Top level categories for categories
- Hidden categories
